# GifTastic

## Overview
In this assignment I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choosing. I had to call the GIPHY API and use Javascript and jQuery to change the HTML. You can also add additional buttons and add gifs to the favorites bar. This project also calls upon the Superhero API database to display information about the characters being selected. 
Additional features and functionality may be added at a later date.

## Purpose
This project help me to understand how APIs are used and called withing a web page as well how different websites use them in different ways.

## Maintenance and Contact
I maintain this project and if you have any questions, comments or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me.
